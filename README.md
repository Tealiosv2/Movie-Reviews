# Mov-E Reviews
A collaborative site between [xegativ](https://github.com/xegativ) and [Tealios](https://github.com/Tealiosv2), made to blog our reviews of various films, shows, and books. The website only uses locomotive-scroll.js for some parallax effects and type.js for the main typing effect. All assets such as graphics and backgrounds were made by xegativ using a mix of Photoshop, Illustrator, and Procreate. 

it's a static website with a focus on the front end.
We hosted this on azure
